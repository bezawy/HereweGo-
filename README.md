# 🏗️ Here We Go - Revit External Application

## 📝 Overview

This is a **Revit External Application** developed using **C#**, **XAML**, and the **Revit API**.  
The app focuses on **modifying** and **selecting elements** inside Revit models.

This guide is designed for **non-programmers** or **new Revit API users** to understand how to **download, run, and use** the application.

---

## 📥 How to Download and Run

### 1️⃣ Install Prerequisites
To run this application, you need:

- **Autodesk Revit** (tested on Revit 2024)
- **Visual Studio** (Recommended: Community Edition)
- **.NET Framework (Version 4.8)**

If you don’t have Visual Studio installed, [download it here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### 2️⃣ Download the Project
- Click on the **Code** button on GitHub and select **Download ZIP**.
- Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

### 3️⃣ Open the Project in Visual Studio
- Open **Visual Studio**.
- Click **File > Open > Project/Solution**.
- Navigate to the extracted folder and open the `.sln` file (Solution File).

### 4️⃣ Build the Project
- Make sure **RevitAPI.dll** and **RevitAPIUI.dll** are referenced correctly.
- Build the solution (`Build > Build Solution`).

### 5️⃣ Load into Revit
- Create a `.addin` manifest file pointing to the compiled `.dll`.
- Launch Revit and find your custom tab called **"Here we go!"**.

## 🎮 How to Use the Application

| **Button**             | **Function**                                         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Delete Manual Item`    | Manually select and delete a single element          |
| `Delete Multiple Items` | Select multiple elements by rectangle and delete     |
| `Create Wall`           | (Coming soon) Create a wall programmatically         |

## 🔍 Understanding the Code (For Curious Users)

This project contains several key parts:

### **1️⃣ XAML UserControl (`MainWindow.xaml`)**
- Builds the **custom WPF interface** inside Revit.
- Contains buttons for user interaction.

### **2️⃣ C# Code (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`)**
- Handles button click events.
- Manages Revit API Transactions.
- Calls `ExternalEvent` handlers to safely run Revit API commands.

### **3️⃣ Generic Selection Filter (`GenericSelections.cs`)**
- Allows the app to filter elements based on category (e.g., Windows).
- Makes rectangle selection easy and reusable.

### **4️⃣ External Event Handlers**
- Two external events created to perform:
  - Manual element deletion.
  - Multi-element deletion.

## 💡 Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**Issue 1: Nothing happens after clicking a button.**  
✔ Ensure you have selected elements properly, or check if Revit is active.

**Issue 2: Error about Transactions outside API context.**  
✔ The app uses **External Events** to handle this correctly. Make sure Revit is ready.

**Issue 3: .addin file is not working.**  
✔ Check that the .addin file points to the correct DLL path.

Would you also like me to create a basic `.addin` file example too, in case you want to share it with users? 🔥
