## 🔍 Code Breakdown

### 🖼️ `MainWindow.xaml`
- Builds the WPF UI with buttons for user interaction.

### ⚙️ `MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Handles button clicks and connects to Revit via `ExternalEvents`.

### 📦 `GenericSelections.cs`
- Provides a reusable element selection filter (by category, etc).

### 🔁 `ExternalEventHandlers`
- Two handlers control:
  - Manual deletion of selected item
  - Deletion of multiple items using selection box

---

## 🛠️ Common Issues

**🔸 Nothing Happens After Click**  
✔ Ensure elements are selected properly and Revit window is active.

**🔸 Error: Transactions outside valid API context**  
✔ This is handled by `ExternalEvent`, but ensure Revit is not busy.

**🔸 .addin File Doesn't Work**  
✔ Double-check the path to your compiled DLL in the `.addin` file.
