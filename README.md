# Here We Go - External App for Revit API

This project is an **External Application** developed for **Autodesk Revit** using the **Revit API**.  
The focus is mainly on **modifying** and **selecting elements** inside the Revit environment.

---

## ‚ú® Overview

- Built as a **Revit External Application** (`IExternalApplication`).
- Adds a custom **tab** and **buttons** inside Revit UI.
- Handles **element selection** and **modification**.
- Designed around creating a **generic selection system** with `ISelectionFilter`.
- Implements **ExternalEvents** to safely perform API operations like delete, select, and modify elements **outside of Execute()** context.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Details

- Created a **UserControl (XAML)** to build a custom WPF UI (MainWindow).
- Set up the **Revit API environment** by:
  - Adding a proper **Add-in Manifest** (`.addin` file).
  - Importing required **RevitAPI.dll** and **RevitAPIUI.dll** libraries.
- Created C# code to:
  - Add **custom buttons** and a **custom ribbon tab**.
  - Attach functionality to buttons for element operations.
- Initial development focuses mainly on **selection** and **deletion** tasks.
- Working toward a **base generic selection filter** that can be extended for multiple categories.

---

## ‚ö° How it Works

- **MainWindow.xaml** hosts the WPF buttons.
- On button clicks:
  - **External Events** are raised to safely start Revit API Transactions.
  - **Two event handlers** are created:
    - One for **manual element deletion**.
    - One for **multiple elements selection and deletion** using **PickElementsByRectangle** and a **custom filter**.

---

## üìÑ Main Concepts Implemented

- `IExternalApplication`
- `IExternalCommand`
- `ISelectionFilter` (Generic and reusable)
- `ExternalEvent` and `IExternalEventHandler`
- WPF UI integration inside Revit
- Safe Transaction management

---

## üöß Current Status

- Project is **still under development**.
- Basic functionality (selecting and deleting) is **working**.
- Planning to extend with:
  - **More generic selection filters**.
  - **Modify elements** (parameters, geometry, etc.).
  - **More structured event handling**.

## üì∑ Screenshot (Coming Soon!)

*(Will add UI screenshots and working examples.)*

---

## üß† Learning Goals

- Mastering the **Revit API** structure for external apps.
- Creating a **scalable and clean** codebase for future complex operations.
- Building a **user-friendly WPF interface** for Revit tools.
- Managing **safe transactions** across Revit UI and external commands.

---

## üöÄ Future Plans

- Implement **element parameter modification**.
- Add **multi-category** selection (e.g., Windows + Doors together).
- Build a **full tool suite** for selection, modification, and batch operations inside Revit.

---

## üìö Requirements

- Autodesk Revit (tested on 2024 version)
- Visual Studio 2022+
- .NET Framework 4.8
- RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll referenced properly
